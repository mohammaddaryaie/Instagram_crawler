I try to add some codes that gather Instagram data such as comments, likes, followers, following and so on.

1- you should download geckodriver.exe (win or linux) and copy its file to specific directory. And, set its directory in __init__ function of class.

2- in Constant class, you shoud add your directory in c_home_directory variable.Next, copy all text files in the directory.

3- in insta.py file, when you want create the object of InstagramBot you should enter your username and password.
